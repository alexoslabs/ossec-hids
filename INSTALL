OSSEC v2016-02


= Recommended Installation =

Installing OSSEC is very easy. We spent a lot of time automating the
installation process as much as possible and choosing sane defaults that 
are useful for the majority of cases.

It works well on most Linux distributions and *BSD systems.

To get started:


1- Download OSSEC: 
   # wget https://bitbucket.org/dcid/ossec-hids/get/tip.tar.gz

2- Install gcc and make. It comes by default on all BSD's and can be
   easily installed by running "apt-get install gcc make" on Debian/Ubuntu
   or "yum install gcc make" on CentOS/RedHat.

3- Run the script ./install.sh. It will guide you through the 
   installation process.
   # cd *ossec*
   # ./install.sh

4- The install script will create everything necessary and get you
   up and running in a few minutes. Once completed, just run:

   # /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control start

   To start OSSEC.

5- If you are running it on multiple servers, make sure to install
   the manager first and the agent install on the others. Use the manage_agents 
   tool to create the right encryption keys.

6- Enjoy.
