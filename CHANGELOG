OSSEC dcid-fork changelog. This are the changes I have been pushing live 
to my personal OSSEC fork. It is also integrating some changes we have done
for Sucuri's internal use.

Every few months we create a stable release with these changes mostly for
internal use, but it is open for anyone to get as well.
